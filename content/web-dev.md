ยก THIS IS A DRAFT !

First, see the
[Awesome CL list](https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl#network-and-internet).

See also the [Cookbook's issue](https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook/issues/105).

Information is at the moment scarce and spread appart, Lisp web
frameworks and libraries evolve and take different approaches.

I'd like to know what's possible, what's lacking, see how to
quickstart everything, see code snippets and, most of all, see how to
do things that I couldn't do before such as hot reloading, building
self-contained executables, shipping a multiplatform web app.

# Web frameworks

## Servers - Hunchentoot, Clack

## Websockets

## URL routing

## Session an cookies

## Data storage

### SQL

[Mito](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito) works for MySQL, Postgres
and SQLite3 on SBCL and CCL.

We can define models with a regular class which has a `mito:dao-table-class` `:metaclass`:

~~~lisp
(defclass user ()
  ((name :col-type (:varchar 64)
         :initarg :name
         :accessor user-name)
   (email :col-type (:varchar 128)
          :initarg :email
          :accessor user-email))
  (:metaclass mito:dao-table-class)
  (:unique-keys email))
~~~

We create the table with `ensure-table-exists`:

~~~lisp
(ensure-table-exists 'user)
;-> ;; CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "user" (
;       "id" BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
;       "name" VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
;       "email" VARCHAR(128),
;       "created_at" TIMESTAMP,
;       "updated_at" TIMESTAMP
;   ) () [0 rows] | MITO.DAO:ENSURE-TABLE-EXISTS
~~~


### Persistent datastores

### Migrations

[Mito](https://github.com/fukamachi/mito) has migrations support and
DB schema versioning for MySQL, Postgres and SQLite3, on SBCL and
CCL. Once we have changed our model definition, we have commands to
see the generated SQL and to apply the migration.


We inspect the SQL: (suppose we just added the email field into the `user` class above)

~~~lisp
(mito:migration-expressions 'user)
;=> (#<SXQL-STATEMENT: ALTER TABLE user ALTER COLUMN email TYPE character varying(128), ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL>
;    #<SXQL-STATEMENT: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_user_email ON user (email)>)
~~~

and we can apply the migration:

~~~lisp
(mito:migrate-table 'user)
;-> ;; ALTER TABLE "user" ALTER COLUMN "email" TYPE character varying(128), ALTER COLUMN "email" SET NOT NULL () [0 rows] | MITO.MIGRATION.TABLE:MIGRATE-TABLE
;   ;; CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "unique_user_email" ON "user" ("email") () [0 rows] | MITO.MIGRATION.TABLE:MIGRATE-TABLE
;-> (#<SXQL-STATEMENT: ALTER TABLE user ALTER COLUMN email TYPE character varying(128), ALTER COLUMN email SET NOT NULL>
;    #<SXQL-STATEMENT: CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_user_email ON user (email)>)
~~~


[Crane](https://github.com/eudoxia0/crane) advertises **automatic**
migrations, i.e. it would run them after a `C-c C-c`. Unfortunately Crane has
some issues, it doesn't work with sqlite yet and the author is busy
elsewhere. It didn't work for me at first try.

Let's hope the author comes back to work on this in a near future.


## Forms

### Form validation

## Debugging

On an error we enter the interactive REPL.


[clack-errors](https://github.com/eudoxia0/clack-errors). Like a Flask
or Django stacktrace in the browser.

> By default, when Clack throws an exception when rendering a page, the server waits for the response until it times out while the exception waits in the REPL. This isn't very useful. So now there's this.

It prints the stacktrace along with some request details on the
browser. Can return a custom error page in production.

[clack-pretend](https://github.com/BnMcGn/clack-pretend)

> Are you tired of jumping to your web browser every time you need to test your work in Clack? Clack-pretend will capture and replay calls to your clack middleware stack. When developing a web application with clack, you will often find it inconvenient to run your code from the lisp REPL because it expects a clack environment, including perhaps, cookies or a logged-in user. With clack-pretend, you can run prior web requests from your REPL, moving development back where it belongs.


## Tests

Testing with a local DB.

We would use [envy](https://github.com/fukamachi/envy) to switch configurations.


## Misc

###  Oauth, Job queues, etc

# Template engines

## HTML-based

**[Djula](https://mmontone.github.io/djula/)**: as Django
templates. Good documentation. Comes by default in Lucerne and Caveman.

We also use a dot to access attributes of dict-like variables (plists,
alists, hash-tables, arrays and CLOS objects), such a feature being
backed by the [access](https://github.com/AccelerationNet/access)
library.

We wanted once to use structs and didn't find how to it directly in
Djula, so we resorted in a quick helper function to transform the
struct in an alist.

**[Eco](https://github.com/eudoxia0/eco)** - a mix of html with lisp expressions.

Truncated example:

~~~
<body>
      <% if posts %>
        <h1>Recent Posts</h1>
        <ul id="post-list">
          <% loop for (title . snippet) in posts %>
            <li><%= title %> - <%= snippet %></li>
          <% end %>
        </ul>
        ...
~~~

## Lisp-based

I prefer the semantics of
[Spinneret](https://github.com/ruricolist/spinneret) over cl-who. It
also has more features (like embeddable markdown).

# Javascript

## Ajax

## The case Weblbocks - Reblocks, 2017

Backend and interactive client in Lisp. In development but simple new quickstart:

http://40ants.com/weblocks/quickstart.html

# Shipping

## Building

We can build an executable also for web apps. That makes for a simple deployment process.

This is the general way:

~~~lisp
(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die #p"name-of-executable" :toplevel #'main-function :executable t)
~~~

we need a step more for web apps:

~~~lisp
(sb-thread:join-thread (find-if (lambda (th)
                                (search "hunchentoot" (sb-thread:thread-name th)))
                              (sb-thread:list-all-threads))))
~~~


A Debian package for every Quicklisp system: [http://margaine.com/2015/12/22/quicklisp-packagecloud-debian-packages.html](http://margaine.com/2015/12/22/quicklisp-packagecloud-debian-packages.html).


## Multiplatform delivery with Electron (Ceramic)

[Ceramic](https://ceramic.github.io/) makes all the work for us.

It is as simple as this:

~~~lisp
;; Load Ceramic and our app
(ql:quickload '(:ceramic :our-app))

;; Ensure Ceramic is set up
(ceramic:setup)
(ceramic:interactive)

;; Start our app (here based on the Lucerne framework)
(lucerne:start our-app.views:app :port 8000)

;; Open a browser window to it
(defvar window (ceramic:make-window :url "http://localhost:8000/"))

;; start Ceramic
(ceramic:show-window window)
~~~

and we can ship this on Linux, Mac and Windows.

More:

> Ceramic applications are compiled down to native code, ensuring both performance and enabling you to deliver closed-source, commercial applications.

(so no need to minify our JS)

with one more line:

~~~lisp
(ceramic.bundler:bundle :ceramic-hello-world
                                 :bundle-pathname #p"/home/me/app.tar")
Copying resources...
Compiling app...
Compressing...
Done!
#P"/home/me/app.tar"
~~~

This last line was buggy for us.

# Deployment

## Connecting to a remote Swank server

Little example here: [http://cvberry.com/tech_writings/howtos/remotely_modifying_a_running_program_using_swank.html](http://cvberry.com/tech_writings/howtos/remotely_modifying_a_running_program_using_swank.html).

It defines a simple function that prints forever:


~~~lisp
;; a little common lisp swank demo
;; while this program is running, you can connect to it from another terminal or machine
;; and change the definition of doprint to print something else out!
;; (ql:quickload :swank)
;; (ql:quickload :bordeaux-threads)

(require :swank)
(require :bordeaux-threads)

(defparameter *counter* 0)

(defun dostuff ()
  (format t "hello world ~a!~%" *counter*))

(defun runner ()
  (bt:make-thread (lambda ()
                    (swank:create-server :port 4006)))
  (format t "we are past go!~%")
  (loop while t do
       (sleep 5)
       (dostuff)
       (incf *counter*)
       ))

(runner)
~~~

On our server, we run it with

    sbcl --load demo.lisp

we do port forwarding on our development machine:

    ssh -L4006:127.0.0.1:4006 username@example.com

this will securely forward port 4006 on the server at example.com to
our local computer's port 4006 (swanks accepts connections from
localhost).

We connect to the running swank with `M-x slime-connect`, typing in
port 4006.

We can write new code:

~~~lisp
(defun dostuff ()
  (format t "goodbye world ~a!~%" *counter*))
(setf *counter* 0)
~~~

and eval it as usual with `M-x slime-eval-region` for instance. The output should change.

There are more pointers on CV Berry's page.


## Hot reload

Example with [Quickutil](https://github.com/tarballs-are-good/quickutil/blob/master/quickutil-server/).

It has a Makefile target:

```lisp
hot_deploy:
	$(call $(LISP), \
		(ql:quickload :quickutil-server) (ql:quickload :swank-client), \
		(swank-client:with-slime-connection (conn "localhost" $(SWANK_PORT)) \
			(swank-client:slime-eval (quote (handler-bind ((error (function continue))) \
				(ql:quickload :quickutil-utilities) (ql:quickload :quickutil-server) \
				(funcall (symbol-function (intern "STOP" :quickutil-server))) \
				(funcall (symbol-function (intern "START" :quickutil-server)) $(start_args)))) conn)) \
		$($(LISP)-quit))
```

It has to be run on the server (a simple fabfile command can call this
through ssh). Beforehand, a `fab update` has run `git pull` on the
server, so new code is present but not running. It connects to the
local swank server, loads the new code, stops and starts the app in a
row.


# Appendice I: Example websites built with Lisp:

* [Quickdocs-server](https://github.com/quickdocs/quickdocs-server) - Caveman, Djula templates, Datafly and Sxql, Envy configuration switcher, Qlot, a simple fabfile for deployment.

  ningle, closure-template, jquery and pjax, hot deploy with
  connection to a swank server, a fabfile, nginx, supervisor, watchdog
  autoreload.
