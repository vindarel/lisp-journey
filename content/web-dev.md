ยก THIS IS A DRAFT !

See also the [Cookbook's issue](https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook/issues/105).

Information is at the moment scarce and spread appart, Lisp web
frameworks and libraries evolve and take different approaches.

I'd like to know what's possible, what's lacking, see how to
quickstart everything, see code snippets.
