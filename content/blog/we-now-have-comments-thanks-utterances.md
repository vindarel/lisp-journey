We just installed a comment system, and it isn't Disqus ! We just
discovered [https://utteranc.es/](utterances), a lightweight widget
based on Github issues. If it doesn't find an issue corresponding to
the current article, it will create one and post your comment
there. Simple :) You dreamed of it ? They did it.
