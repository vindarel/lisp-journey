We continue our tour of GUI toolkits for CL with Gtk+3 and cl-cffi-gtk.

The previosu posts are:

- [part 1:Â Ltk](/blog/gui-programming-in-common-lisp-part-1-of-5-tk/)
- [part 2: Qt4](/blog/gui-programming-in-common-lisp-part-2-of-5-qt4-qtools/)

**This blog post series was initially written for the Common Lisp
Cookbook, you can (and should) read it there:**

## Gtk+3 (cl-cffi-gtk)

[Gtk+3][gtk] is the primary library used to build [GNOME][gnome]
applications. Its (currently most advanced) lisp bindings is
[cl-cffi-gtk][cl-cffi-gtk]. While primarily created for GNU/Linux, Gtk
works fine under macOS and can now also be used on Windows.


- **Framework written in**: C
- **Portability**: GNU/Linux and macOS, also Windows.

- **Widgets choice**: large.

- **Graphical builder**: yes: Glade.
- **Other features**: web browser (WebKitGTK)

- **Bindings documentation**: very good: http://www.crategus.com/books/cl-gtk/gtk-tutorial.html
- **Bindings stability**: stable
- **Bindings activity**: low activity, active development.
- **Licence**: LGPL
- Example applications:
  - an [Atmosphere Calculator](https://github.com/ralph-schleicher/atmosphere-calculator), built with Glade.

## Getting started

The
[documentation](http://www.crategus.com/books/cl-gtk/gtk-tutorial.html)
is exceptionally good, including for beginners.

The library to quickload is `cl-cffi-gtk`. It is made of numerous
ones, that we have to `:use` for our package.

~~~lisp
(ql:quickload :cl-cffi-gtk)

(defpackage :gtk-tutorial
  (:use :gtk :gdk :gdk-pixbuf :gobject
   :glib :gio :pango :cairo :common-lisp))

(in-package :gtk-tutorial)
~~~

**How to run the main loop**

As with the other libraries, everything happens inside the main loop
wrapper, here `with-main-loop`.

**How to create a window**

`(make-instance 'gtk-window :type :toplevel :title "hello" ...)`.

**How to create a widget**

All widgets have a corresponding class. We can create them with
`make-instance 'widget-class`, but we preferably use the constructors.

The constructors end with (or contain) "new":

```lisp
(gtk-label-new)
(gtk-button-new-with-label "Label")
```

**How to create a layout**

~~~lisp
(let ((box (make-instance 'gtk-box :orientation :horizontal :spacing 6))) ...)
~~~

then pack a widget onto the box:

~~~lisp
(gtk-box-pack-start box mybutton-1)
~~~

and add the box to the window:

~~~lisp
(gtk-container-add window box)
~~~

and display them all:

~~~lisp
(gtk-widget-show-all window)
~~~

### Reacting to events

Use `g-signal-connect` + the concerned widget + the event name (as a
string) + a lambda, that takes the widget as argument:

~~~lisp
(g-signal-connect window "destroy"
  (lambda (widget)
    (declare (ignore widget))
    (leave-gtk-main)))
~~~

Or again:

~~~lisp
(g-signal-connect button "clicked"
  (lambda (widget)
    (declare (ignore widget))
    (format t "Button was pressed.~%")))
~~~

### Full example

~~~lisp
(defun hello-world ()
  ;; in the docs, this is example-upgraded-hello-world-2.
  (within-main-loop
    (let ((window (make-instance 'gtk-window
                                 :type :toplevel
                                 :title "Hello Buttons"
                                 :default-width 250
                                 :default-height 75
                                 :border-width 12))
          (box (make-instance 'gtk-box
                              :orientation :horizontal
                              :spacing 6)))
      (g-signal-connect window "destroy"
                        (lambda (widget)
                          (declare (ignore widget))
                          (leave-gtk-main)))
      (let ((button (gtk-button-new-with-label "Button 1")))
        (g-signal-connect button "clicked"
                          (lambda (widget)
                            (declare (ignore widget))
                            (format t "Button 1 was pressed.~%")))
        (gtk-box-pack-start box button))
      (let ((button (gtk-button-new-with-label "Button 2")))
        (g-signal-connect button "clicked"
                          (lambda (widget)
                            (declare (ignore widget))
                            (format t "Button 2 was pressed.~%")))
        (gtk-box-pack-start box button))
      (gtk-container-add window box)
      (gtk-widget-show-all window))))
