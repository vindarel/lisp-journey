title: "These Years in Common Lisp 2018"
date: 2019-02-16T14:42:46+01:00
draft: true
---

It's been already a little more than a year that I began my Lisp
journey. I made quaterly news digests, mainly from reddit's
feed:

- [Q1 2018](/blog/these-months-in-common-lisp-q1-2018/) - [Q2 2018](/blog/these-months-in-common-lisp-q2-2018/) - [Q3 2018](/blog/these-months-in-common-lisp-q3-2018/) - [Q4 2018](/blog/these-months-in-common-lisp-q4-2018/)

Time has come for a yearly overview ! What happened in the Common Lisp
world ? Are there (or groundbreaking promising useful fun) projects,
articles, discussions, tutorials ?

No need to say, I won't reference everything we find in the quaterly
posts, which don't list all new projects appearing on Quicklisp (we
can find these in the
[monthly Quicklisp releases](http://blog.quicklisp.org)) or Github.

I hope this overview will sharpen your interest on what is in my
opinion an under-sold and still very promising language and plateform,
that I happen to like more and more (and sooo more than Python ;) ).

Happy discoveries.

# Documentation

Common Lisp's online documentation could be more thorough and
welcoming. Fortunately, a few of us revived some projects and work on
it -my favourite project being the Common Lisp Coobook. This year, we
got tutorials on:

- [Datastructures](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/data-structures.html)
- [Debugging](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/debugging.html), including how to interactively debug a spacecraft,
- [the Common Lisp Object System (CLOS)](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/clos.html)
- [Loop, iteration, mapping](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/iteration.html)
- [Database access and persistence](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/databases.html)
- [Error and condition handling](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/error_handling.html)
- [Numbers](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/numbers.html) and [multidimensional arrays](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/arrays.html)
- [Scripting and building self-contained executables](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/scripting.html)

along with many improvements on other pages, like on [getting started](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/getting-started.html) and [editor support](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/editor-support.html).

Which brings me to it: the editors situation is much more open than
you think:

- The editor of choice is still **Emacs** with Slime (or
Sly), 
- However, we can get started with Emacs and Lisp in 3 clicks with **Portacle**, a *self-contained batteries-included sbcl-included portable* Emacs tailored for CL, <!-- followed closely by **(Neo)Vim** ; what does "followed closely" mean here? --> 
- For **Vim** and **NeoVim** we have SLIMV, VLIME, and plugins can be written for NeoVim using [cl-neovim](https://github.com/adolenc/cl-neovim).
- Or if we want an editor written in  cl, there's the self-contained **Lem** editor, which also works for Python, Go, Rust, Nim, Scheme, HTML, JSX, alongwith a directory mode, an experimental LSP mode, calc-mode, 
- Not to forget that Mac Os X users can use the [Clozure Common Lisp IDE](https://ccl.clozure.com/docs/ccl.html#the-clozure-cl-ide)
- All editions of LispWorks (including the free) include the [LW IDE](http://www.lispworks.com/products/ide.html)
- For users of **Eclipse IDE**, there is the Dandelion plugin <!-- REALLY? i thought this was abandonware -->
- For popular editors, the experience is very good on **Atom** and the popular **Visual Studio Code** can be made to work with CL using [cl-lsp](https://github.com/cxxxr/cl-lsp).

- For interactive notebooks we have **ipython-like REPL** (cl-repl), **Jupyter kernels** and yet another
notebook (Darkmatter). 

A very welcome improvement is the Common Lisp fundation's website:
https://common-lisp.net/ It got a massive update and is now
attractive. We had http://lisp-lang.org/ (don't miss its success
stories section), but common-lisp.net was a googlers' honey pot.

This website uses two "awesome" lists that were created or massively
furnished last year:
- the [Awesome-CL](https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl) list,
  updated with hundreds of commits, which hopefully makes for a more
  discoverable and appealing ecosystem, and
- [Awesome Lisp Companies](https://github.com/azzamsa/awesome-lisp-companies):
  it was needed because Lispers didn't know a lot of companies using
  CL appart from IRobot, Google's ITA (powering
  [Kayak](http://kayak.com/), [Orbitz](http://orbitz.com/) and
  others), Grammatech, YCombinator, Siscog or other dead ones.


Other places to learn Common Lisp include:

- [cl-exercise: a Common Lisp Learning System running on browsers](https://www.reddit.com/r/lisp/comments/a9at82/clexercise_common_lisp_learning_system_running_on/)
- coding schools, like [Kattis](https://open.kattis.com/help)
- and competitive Programming websites like CodeForces,
   HackerEarth, HackerRank, and CodeChef.

We also regularly have new screencasts to enjoy:
- a lot being from [Baggers](https://github.com/cbaggers/): he does the following and he streams live nearly weekly
  * [little bits of Lisp](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2VAYZE_4wRJi_vgpjsH75kMhN4KsuzR_): short videos to learn Lisp basics
  * [lots of bits of Lisp](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=lots+of+bits+of+lisp+): long videos to dive deep in advanced subjects (macros, CFFI,…)
  * [Pushing pixels with Lisp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=82o5NeyZtvw&list=PL2VAYZE_4wRITJBv6saaKouj4sWSG1FcS): mostly working with OpenGL
  * and [more](https://www.youtube.com/user/CBaggers/playlists) !
- [Shinmera](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDl6Irujx9MtJPRRP5KBH40SGCenztPW)
  has lots of videos too, we can see him working on game engines,
  games, his libraries, Qt applications and more,
- the [CL study group](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7V5BL6W3CA) (here, an introduction to Screamer, a non-deterministic programming library)


# Implementations

Time is good for Common Lisp implementations. Most date back from
decades and already proved what they can do (remember, SBCL is a
descendant of the Lisp that went to space). Hence the lack of hype,
IMO. Yet, many are in active development, and keep improving. As
`/u/defunkydrummer` observed:

> We are lucky to live in a time where Lisp development is still ongoing, many teams carrying the flag of open-source Lisp:

> - SBCL (new release today)
> - SICL (last commit 2 hours ago)
> - ECL (last commit, yesterday),
> - CLASP (last commit 2 days ago)
> - CCL (last commit 7 days ago),
> - CLISP (two weeks ago),
> - CMUCL (1 month ago)
> - ABCL (3 months ago)

SBCL has monthly releases. If you read the release notes, you might worry:

> the amount of changes in each release is decreasing these years

but, as `/u/baggers` notes:

> I think the commits tell a slightly different tale though. There is always a lot of background 'making stuff better' work than won't appear as the explanation would either be ultra internal and specific or would be super vague and very similar each month (for example 'stuff is slightly faster').
>
> For one that would be overly specific [this one](https://github.com/sbcl/sbcl/commit/adc83086ff26c46e647b22d76fe22d57889b6ace) might make for a good example. It's grand work, but doesn't surface in any specific lisp feature, stuff is just better.

Furthermore, a maintainer:

> Or the developers are too lazy to describe their changes.

which isn't a good reason ;)

We got a new release of Corman Lisp, a high performance Windows/32bit specific implementation with a built in IDE,

we have CLASP, targetting C++ through LLVM (see [“Lessons Learned Implementing Common Lisp with LLVM”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mbdXeRBbgDM&app=desktop)), built with the Cleavir compiler, part of SICL, a very
new implementation of Common Lisp with fresh ideas,

we have ABCL targetting the JVM, Embedable Common Lisp, without
forgetting active commercial ones, like LispWorks and AllegroCL. While
I'm at it, you might want to have a look at
[MOCL](https://wukix.com/mocl) for IOs, Android and OSx.

We got a nice talk by Clozure Common Lisp's maintainer:
[this Old Lisp](http://thisoldlisp.com/) (this one may be the second
most used implementation, particularly good for development -- super fast
compilation times (I heard it compiles itself in seconds), [advising](https://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter4.3.html#Advising), [watched objects](https://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter4.12.html#watched-objects), [code coverage](https://ccl.clozure.com/manual/chapter4.13.html#code-coverage), and its own [IDE](https://ccl.clozure.com/docs/ccl.html#the-clozure-cl-ide)).

So: welcome to this new world. It's bigger than I thought, for sure.
