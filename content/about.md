My **Common Lisp journey**. Discovering the language and the ecosystem. edit: and now writing applications, libraries and running a web app in production.

I will post short articles about libraries, code snippets, other
resources, tips and tricks, opinions.
I port all I can to the
[Cookbook](https://github.com/LispCookbook/cl-cookbook). I also keep a
close eye on the
[Awesome-cl](https://github.com/CodyReichert/awesome-cl) list. You
should contribute to them too!

Because Common Lisp is the most hidden world I know. It's puzzling and
a shame, really.

I have some experience with a Lisp writting [Emacs Lisp packages](https://gitlab.com/emacs-stuff/), but I
mostly ~~write~~ wrote Python (and Javascript) at work and for my personal
projects, for more than heighgt years. I am frustrated by its limitations and I see great potential
in CL for web apps, specially with the [awesome update of Weblocks going on](https://github.com/40ants/weblocks/blob/reblocks/docs/source/quickstart.rst), so this will be the direction of my wanderings. edit: awesome, I contributed :)

I am **vindarel** on Github and Gitlab: https://github.com/vindarel/ (and "dzecniv" on reddit).

You can thank me and support me financially [on Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/vindarel) and [on Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/vindarel/). I currently don't have a fixed, nor big, income, so it helps. I would like to write more about CL, specially about web development.

If I were backed I would:

- enhance the Cookbook further, with more recipes, a better theme, and generate a PDF.
- write a proper Cookbook for web development
- create web starter kits
- create videos
- interview lispers and companies using CL
- spend (even) more time on libraries, and software, and share my experience.

My CL projects you could use are:

- the Cookbook. I put it in its useful shape and I wrote a lot.
- [str](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-str) - a simple and consistent string manipulation library
- [replic](https://github.com/vindarel/replic) - helps build readline
  applications from an existing library in no time. It brings the
  REPL, the help system, a system to quickly define the completion of
  a command's arguments, etc. It came naturally after writing a couple
  readline apps (with cl-readline which I'm only the new maintainer).
- [cl-torrents](https://github.com/vindarel/cl-torrents) - a CLI,
  terminal and (very simple) GUI tool to search for torrents on
  popular trackers. With a proof-of-concept Weblocks web client.
- a [hot reload example for web apps](https://github.com/vindarel/lisp-web-live-reload-example/issues) as well as a [web project skeleton](https://github.com/vindarel/lisp-web-template-productlist).
- [abstock](https://gitlab.com/vindarel/abstock), an online catalogue for books (and other products). I run it in productionÂ© and it helps real bookshops.

I also contributed to awesome projects, such as the Next browser (+200 commits in 2019) or the Weblocks web framework. I fix bugs when I see them.
